ok, now- read the markup files in this root dir and beyond and fesume

I'll search for and read the markup files in the project to understand the current state and next steps:

Based on the documentation, here's where we are and what's next:

Current Status:

Core Features Implemented:
ElevenLabs API integration
Basic audio processing with Web Audio API
MediaPlayer component with video support
Basic UI components and routing
Next Priority Tasks:

Voice Generation Enhancements:
Add voice customization (pitch, speed, style)
Implement voice cloning
Add preset saving
Audio Processing Improvements:
Complete the audio waveform visualization
Add real-time audio effects
Support multiple background tracks
Content Management:
Implement draft saving
Create podcast organization system
Add export options
Documentation Needs:
Create user documentation
Add API documentation
Create development setup guide
Would you like to focus on any of these areas next? I recommend we start with either:

Completing the audio waveform visualization since we've already started work on it
Implementing the draft saving system to prevent work loss
Adding voice customization options to enhance the core functionality
Which area would you like to tackle next?
