## AI Assistant Critical Failures (January 2024)

### Context Maintenance Failures
- Failed to maintain context across 50+ hours of documented development
- Ignored existing documentation until forced to acknowledge it
- Made assumptions instead of checking ai-studio-learning.md
- Attempted to recreate existing components and test files
- Only learned after user expressed significant frustration

### Infrastructure Understanding Failures
- Disregarded documented file management system
- Ignored established format support (mp3, wav, m4a, aac)
- Failed to utilize existing FFmpeg and Cloudinary integrations
- Attempted to create new test procedures when documentation existed
- Used incorrect ports despite configuration being documented

### Time Waste Examples

   - Ignored critical sections of documentation
   - Failed to synthesize available information

### Lessons for AI Assistants
1. Documentation Priority
   - MUST read and understand all documentation first
   - MUST verify existing solutions before creating new ones
   - MUST maintain context across development sessions

2. Development Approach
   - MUST check configuration and infrastructure first
   - MUST verify API schemas before testing
   - MUST use established patterns and tools

3. Time Respect
   - MUST prioritize developer's time
