## 2024 Updates

### ContentCard Component Refactor (Latest)

#### What Was Done
1. Simplified ContentCard component to use a single `content` object prop
2. Updated UI elements:
   - Added status badge (published/draft)
   - Removed selection checkbox
   - Simplified stats to show creation date
   - Added disabled state for play button
3. Improved data handling:
   - Added fallback for missing thumbnails
   - Added fallback for missing descriptions
   - Integrated audioUrl check for playability

#### Expected Behavior
1. Component should:
   - Display podcast/video content with thumbnail
   - Show status (published/draft) and content type
   - Enable play only when audioUrl exists
   - Support edit and delete operations
2. Data flow should:
   - Accept content object from parent component
   - Pass full content object to action handlers
   - Handle missing data gracefully

#### Failure Scenarios and Solutions

If we encounter issues, here's the plan:

1. **Thumbnail Loading Issues**
   - Current: Using fallback placeholder
   - If fails: Add error boundary and implement progressive image loading

2. **Audio Playback Problems**
   - Current: Disabled state when no audioUrl
   - If fails: 
     - Add audio format validation
     - Implement audio preload checks
     - Add detailed error messaging

3. **Action Handler Failures**
   - Current: Passing full content object
   - If fails:
     - Add error handling in parent components
     - Implement retry mechanism
     - Add user feedback for failed operations

4. **Missing Content Properties**
   - Current: Using fallbacks for description and thumbnail
   - If fails:
     - Add prop validation
     - Implement default values for all optional fields
     - Add warning logs for missing required fields

#### Next Steps
1. Implement comprehensive testing:
   - Unit tests for all content states
   - Integration tests with parent components
   - Edge case testing for missing data

2. Add performance optimizations:
   - Implement memo for expensive renders
   - Add lazy loading for thumbnails
   - Cache frequently accessed content

3. Enhance user experience:
   - Add loading states
   - Improve error messages
   - Add tooltips for disabled states

4. Monitor and iterate:
   - Track component performance
   - Gather user feedback
   - Address any emerging issues
